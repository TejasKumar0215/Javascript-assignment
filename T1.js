"Government at the Centre is using common people's money to support their closest friends. Congress party has decided to have nationwide agitation across districts of the country in front of LIC and SBI offices on Monday," 
 ANI quoted Congress general secretary KC Venugopal as saying.
According to Congress, the exposure of LIC and public sector banks like the SBI to the Adani Group has significant implications for middle-class savings.
